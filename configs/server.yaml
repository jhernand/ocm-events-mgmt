# This is an example configuration file intended to run the service in a local
# development environment outside of a cluster. To use it copy it to your
# favorite location, edit it, and run the service:
#
#  $ cp configs/development.yml ~/my_server.yml
#  $ vi ~/my_server.yml
#  $ ./events-mgmt server ~/my_server.yml
#
# Note that you will need to change at least the `auth.client_id` and `auth.client_secret`
# parameters. To find out the values ask in the #service-development channel.
#
# For more instructions on how to setup your development environment see the
# `README.adoc` file.
